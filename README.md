# My first deep learning model

The course is being taught by [Jeremy Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSvpQjSnJJ_PmDQB_VyT5iU&index=1) and is the best course on Deep Learning out there. You don't need high level maths or statistics or the like. Just familiarity with Python!
The original code was by Jeremy and you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/riyanswt/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data) with slight modifications.
